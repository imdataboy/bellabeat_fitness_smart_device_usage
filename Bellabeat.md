## About the dataset

- The dataset is located in this
  [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) made available
  by fitness tracking device under brand Fitbit open/public data,
  collected by third party [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic).  
- This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via
  Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016.  
- 30 eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal
  tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity,
  heart rate, and sleep monitoring.  
- The dataset is under creative commons license which claims No
  Copyright and allows copy, modify, distribute and perform the work,
  even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission. See
  [Other
  Information](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).  
- The dataset conatains **18 files**:

``` r

## Cleaning the data

### Tools used

**powerquery:** to merge and clean the data.  
**SQL:** to analyse the data.  
**R:** to analyse and visualize the data.

### Setting up our dataset

- the **dailyActivity_merged** file contains column data from
  **dailyCalories_merged**, **dailyIntensities_merged**,
  **dailySteps_merged**.

#### merging Hourly activities data using excel and power query

**step 1:** Gathering hourly datasets in the same workbook.  
![](C:/Users/isach/OneDrive/Bureau/projects/Bellabeat/screenshots/1_gathering_houry_dataset_in_the_same_workbook.png)

**step 2:** Merging Hourly Data Using Power Query in Excel.

![](C:/Users/isach/OneDrive/Bureau/projects/Bellabeat/screenshots/3_merge_hourly1.png)  
**same thing was done to minutes data but before we need to clean the
date columns of each file using power query**

### Cleaning the dates

step 1: Spliting the column by 11 characters. This will separate Date
and Time.  
![](C:/Users/isach/OneDrive/Bureau/projects/Bellabeat/screenshots/spliting_dates_by_number_to_separate_between_date_and_time.png)

step 2: Spliting the Date column by “/” Delimiter.  
![](C:/Users/isach/OneDrive/Bureau/projects/Bellabeat/screenshots/spliting_dates_by_delimiter_to_separate_between_days_years_month.png)

step 3: Changing the data type of the newly created columns to Whole
number.  
![](C:/Users/isach/OneDrive/Bureau/projects/Bellabeat/screenshots/changing_data_type_to_whole_number.png)

step 4: Merging Columns using “/”Separator.  
![](C:/Users/isach/OneDrive/Bureau/projects/Bellabeat/screenshots/merging_the_splited_column.png)

step 5: merging date and_minutes columns and chanching the column type
to date/time.

### Analysing and Visualizing the data

creating a new column that contains weekdays for daily_activity data.

``` r
daily_act$activity_date <- as.Date(daily_act$activity_date)

daily_act$day_of_week <- weekdays(daily_act$activity_date)
daily_act$day_of_week <- factor(daily_act$day_of_week, levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))
```

Smart Device Usage by Weekdays.

``` r
plot_2 <- ggplot(data = daily_act, aes(x= day_of_week, fill = day_of_week)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Smart Device Usage by Weekdays", x = "Weekdays", y = "Count")+
  theme_minimal()
```

![](C:/Users/isach/OneDrive/Bureau/projects/Bellabeat/plots/Smart_Device_Usage_by_Weekdays.png)  
This bar chart depicts the distribution of smart device usage across
weekdays, providing insights into the most and least popular days of
device usage.

``` r
active_minutes <- daily_act %>%
  select(contains("_minutes")) %>%
  colSums()

active_minutes_all <- data.frame(activity_type = names(active_minutes), 
                                 minutes = active_minutes)

plot_3 <- ggplot(active_minutes_all, aes(x = activity_type, y = minutes)) +

  theme_minimal()
```

![](C:/Users/isach/OneDrive/Bureau/projects/Bellabeat/plots/total_active_min_by_avtivity_type.png)  
The plot shows the total active minutes for different activity types.
Users spend the most time in sedentary activities, followed by lightly
active. Very active activities have the lowest total minutes.
Understanding these patterns can help promote more physical activity and
tailor fitness programs accordingly.

correlation_coefficient
```

    ## [1] 0.9304575

the plot suggests that as the total time spent in bed increases, the
total minutes asleep also tend to increase. This positive correlation
indicates that people are more likely to spend more time asleep when
they spend more time in bed.

## Conclusion

Our goal was to discover how do non-Bellabeat smart devices users use
non_bellabeat products.By looking at the data, we’re able to find out
that :

- Tuesday and Wednesday were the most popular days for smart device
  usage among non-Bellabeat smart device users, while Monday was the
  least popular.  
- The distribution of smart device usage across weekdays suggests that
  users may be more active and engaged with their devices during the
  middle of the week.  
- Users spend the most time in sedentary activities, followed by lightly
  active activities. Very active activities have the lowest total
  minutes.This insight indicates that users may have a significant
  portion of their day involving sedentary activities, highlighting the
  need to encourage more physical activity and promote healthier
  lifestyles.  
- Mornings and afternoons are the most popular time periods for smart
  device usage among non-Bellabeat smart device users.This insight
  indicates that users are likely to use their devices more frequently
  in the afternoons, which could be related fitness tracking habits.  
- Users are more likely to engage in walking or active activities during
  afternoons and mornings.  
- As users spend more time in bed, they tend to spend more time asleep,
  indicating a positive relationship between these two variables.

## Recommendations

Since our **gaol** is to to apply these insights into one of the
Bellabeat smart devices(**Bellabeat app**). We can:

- Since Tuesday and Wednesday were the most popular days for smart
  device usage, we can consider running targeted promotions and
  challenges during these days to encourage user engagement. This can
  help maintain user interest and activity levels throughout the week.  
- Given that users spend the most time in sedentary activities, we need
  to focus on features and notifications that encourage users to be more
  physically active.  
- Include a sleep diary feature in the app where users can log their
  sleep-related activities, such as bedtime, wake-up time, sleep
  quality, and any disturbances during the night. This diary can help
  users track their progress and identify patterns affecting their
  sleep.  
- Regularly collect user feedback to understand their needs and
  preferences and Use it to continuously improve the user experience.
